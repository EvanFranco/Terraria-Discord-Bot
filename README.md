# Terraria-Discord-Bot
Every summer I play a game called Terraria with my brothers. However, it gets annoying to open a
tab search and find the specific page to the wiki

	Using a Node.js environment and used Discord API to query a wiki database for item lookups. 
	Configured a three-node MongoDB replica set for high availability, ensuring data durability and bot operation in case of server failures.
	Deployed the bot to a cloud-hosted infrastructure without the need for local hosting; Used across 5+ servers,
	Bot calls parallel read operations across multiple MongoDB servers to fetch data to ensure no latency.
