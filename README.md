# Terraria-Discord-Bot
Every summer I play a game called Terraria with my brothers. However, it gets annoying to open a
tab search and find the specific page to the wiki. Using a Node.Js environment I made a discord bot
that automatically sends you a link to the wiki website if that item exists.

Uses MongoDB to store usersâ€™ information to track experience gain. The more the bot is sued more
exp the user earns. This builds engagement for users to use the bot
